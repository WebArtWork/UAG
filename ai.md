# AI context

- Purpose: tracked note for AI/human collaborators about how we work in this repo.
- Always read `local-context.md` at session start to pick up machine-specific paths, approvals, and transient hints (it’s git-ignored; never commit).
- Cross-environment practices and reusable context should be captured here (or in tracked docs) so they travel with the repo.
- Follow `AGENTS.md`: no backdoors, no discretionary power, AI output is untrusted until reviewed, and protocol rules must be enforced in code.
